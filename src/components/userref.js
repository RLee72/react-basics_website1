/*
The TextInputWithFocusButton component can be used in situations where you want to provide a button that, when clicked, automatically focuses an input field. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to enhance the user experience by making it more convenient for users to start typing immediately without manually clicking on the input field.

Some possible use cases for this component could be:

Forms: When a form loads, you might want to automatically focus on the first input field, making it easier for users to start filling out the form without having to manually select the input field.

Search bars: In a search functionality, you can provide a button that, when clicked, focuses on the search input field, allowing users to quickly start typing their search query.

User interactions: If you have an interactive component that requires user input, such as a chatbox or a comment section, you can provide a button that focuses on the input field, ensuring a smooth user experience.
